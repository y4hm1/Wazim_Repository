                <h2><a href="https://lukeandnik.co.uk/">Website 1: Luke and Nick</a></h2>
                <h2>Home Page</h2>
                <p class="captions">This is the website of an artist duo (Luke & Nick) who are working with photography
                    and motion image</p>
                <img class="images" src="assets/images/w1h1PC.png">
                <p class="captions">I found their home page very intriguing since
                    it was very unconventional when compared to the average website which follows most UI rules.
                    The main content that is being displayed on the website has no sense of symmetry and doesn't
                    show any consistent spacing or proximity between the images. Their alignment is also not always
                    symmetrical nor is the size. The navigation is a very minimalist design with only three buttons and
                    very
                    simple animations when interacted with like transition from bold to light.</p>
                <div class="container">
                    <figure>
                    <img id="phone1" class="images" src="assets/images/w1h1Phone.png">
                    <figcaption>Phone</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img id="tablet1" class="images" src="assets/images/w1h1Tablet.png">
                    <figcaption>Tablet</figcaption>
                </figure>
                </div>
                <p class="captions">This however helps in catching the eye of the user to multiple different content
                    that is
                    being displayed. The hierarchy is given to the images displayed in large sizes on the menu, they
                    keep
                    moving around and changing when you scroll. The screen also keeps adapting to
                    the screen size of the device you're using. I've presented how they look on PC, mobile and tablet.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="w1page1">
                <h2>Page 1</h2>
                <p class="captions">This is an index page which gives the user access to navigate through the website.
                </p>
                <img class="images" src="assets/images/w1pg1PC.png">
                <p class="captions">A cool thing about this website is that if you stay idle some strange shapes appear
                    on the screen
                    which go away only when you hover over them with your cursor. The website uses a very modern font
                    which I found
                    very appealing. It looks similar to the font that OnePlus uses and the overall typography of the
                    website is done
                    really well. The text becomes lighter
                    when you hover over it
                    indicating that it has been selected.</p>
                <div class="container">

                    <img id="phone1" class="images" src="assets/images/w1pg1Phone.png">

                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                    <img id="tablet1" class="images" src="assets/images/w1pg1Tablet.png">
                    <figcaption>Tablet</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p class="captions">The layout of the website is very standard. It only had a single main column and one
                    main navigation
                    bar for primary navigation. Some of the text overlap the contact and then change into their negative
                    color.
                    This provides a very nice visual contrast.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="w1page2">
                <h2>Page 2</h2>
                <p class="captions">This is the page that appears when you click on one of the categories of images
                    above in the index
                    page of the website.
                </p>
                <img class="images" src="assets/images/w1pg2PC.png">
                <p class="captions">The close button is on the top right of the screen and I find it a little annoying
                    that it is
                    very far away and feel like it would have been better to just place an X symbol instead of “Close”.
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p class="captions">The images can be changes with the arrows displayed on the far right and left side.
                    There is no
                    interaction or hover animation for them though. The spacing in the content and text
                    is not consistent but it has quite evidently been done on purpose as the website gives out that vibe
                    of “out of the
                    box”.

                <h2>Home Page</h2>
                <p class="captions">Youtube is one of the most popular free video sharing
                    websites which make it easier to watch videos online.</p>
                <img class="images" src="assets/images/yt home pc.png">
                <p class="captions">YouTube's home page is extremely user friendly and very straight-forward. 
                    It does a very good job at displaying videos to the user with a good level of proximity and 
                    follows the Gestalts law in terms of everything being very consistent. The layout is very symmetrical 
                    and well aligned. The visual hierarchy is well presented, giving the most information, that is the 
                    videos the spotlight. The placement of all the buttons and CTAs are well done and very simple to 
                    understand.</p>
                <div class="container">

                </div>
                <p class="captions">The UI is also responsive to
                    different screen sizes and 
                    has adapted well to the different aspect ratios. This sidebar helps in organizing the content 
                    and displays a selection of videos just for you.
                    You can also get access to your subscriptions 
                    and created playlists here. The interaction of 
                    hover is a simple animation that lights up the 
                    text and section around it.
                </p>

                <h2>Page 1</h2>
                <p class="captions">This is the page that appears when you click on your liked videos and the layout of it is that 
                    of any of your Youtube playlists created by either you or YouTube itself.
                </p>
                <img class="images" src="assets/images/yt page1 pc.png">
                <p class="captions">The typography of the website is also 
                    very clean and simple. The important text is highlighted and indicated very well and the font which is 
                    Roboto is also easy to understand and aesthetically pleasing. The layout of YouTube is well planned 
                    out and it follows a multiple column grid.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="captions">It also abides by the F pattern and presents it's information in terms of an F like manner. 
                    The page that appears when you click on a playlist is mostly single column and it 
                    presents the information about each video well and the Gaussian blur also helps increasing the complexity of the screen.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="w2page2">
                <h2>Page 2</h2>
                <p class="captions">This is the  page that appears when you click on a video. It consists of a video player, comments 
                    description of the video and more recommended videos from Youtube on the left-hand side.
                </p>
                <img class="images" src="assets/images/yt page2 pc.png">
                <p class="captions">The interactions and animations on the buttons are subtle yet have a large 
                    impact on the entire design of the website. The video players is also well designed with 
                    clean and simple icons and provide a lot of options as well and it has places in a way 
                    where it does not seem like too many options either.

                    it is simple for the user to differentiate between different sections of the page and 
                    different videos. It's a perfect website for people who are new to the internet and not so 
                    used to technology.
