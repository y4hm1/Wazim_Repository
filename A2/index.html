                <p>Often the starting point for all artistic expression, the line is one of the 
                    most essential elements of design. It always has more length than thickness, 
                    and can be unbroken, broken, or implied. A line can be vertical, diagonal, 
                    horizontal, and even curved. It can be any width, size, shape, position, 
                    direction, interval, or density.

                <p>All objects are composed of shapes, and all elements of design are shapes in some way. 
                    Shapes can live in a form. An example would be a button on a website: It's a 
                    shape that's living inside the computer (which is the form).

                    A shape is a two- or three-dimensional object that stands out from the space next 
                    to it because of a defined or implied boundary. A shape can live in different 
                    areas in space, and have other elements like line, color, texture, or 
                    movement. Like forms, shapes come in two different types: geometric and organic.

                <p>
                    Forms are three dimensional, and there are two types: geometric (man-made) and 
                    natural (organic). A digital or physical form can be measured by height, 
                    width, and depth. A form can be created by combining shapes, and it can 
                    be enhanced by color or texture. Depending on their usage, they can also 
                    be ornate or utilitarian.

                <p>
                    Objects in space can occur in both two and three dimensions. In a 
                    two-dimensional setting, space is about creating the illusion of 
                    a third dimension on a flat surface. Shadows, shading, overlap, 
                    and sizing can help define an object's place in space. For 
                    example, a button could have a shadow that makes it feel 
                    like it's closer to the user.
                    Space, like color, is an element that does not have to be 
                    used. But when it is, it's a powerful way to add emphasis.

                <p>
                    Texture is the way a surface feels, or the way it's perceived to 
                    feel. It has the power to attract or detract a viewer's eyes, 
                    and can be applied to lines, shapes, and forms.

                    There are two types of texture: tactile and visual. Tactile 
                    textures are three-dimensional and can be touched. The easiest 
                    example is tree bark. When you touch bark, you can feel all the 
                    bumps and ridges, the roughness and smoothness. A photo of the same 
                    bark would be a visual texture. You can see it, not feel it.
