        <h1>The Paradox Ending</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
        <p>
            In this ending, the choices you've made during your time-traveling adventures have caused significant
            disruptions in the fabric of time. The consequences of your actions have led to a paradox, a tangled web of
            events that defy explanation. When you return to the present, you are met with a world in chaos. Historical
            figures are out of place, critical moments in history have been altered beyond recognition, and you realize
            that the continuum of time has been irreparably damaged.
        </p>

        <p>
            You find yourself grappling with the weight of the paradox you've created, a haunting reminder of the
            unforeseen consequences of your choices. Your once-familiar world has become a strange and unpredictable
            place, and you must now navigate this disordered reality, searching for a way to restore the natural flow of
            time or to live with the chaos you've inadvertently unleashed.
